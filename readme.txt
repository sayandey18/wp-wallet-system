WooCommerce Wallet System  allows customers to make the online payment from their Wallet. In this plugin,
the admin can manually debit or credit amount into the customerâ€™s wallet. You can offer your customers a new
convenient way of paying for goods and services. The wallet is an online prepaid account where one can stock
money, to be used when required. There is no chance of a decline in payment since wallet is a prepaid account.

As it is a pre-loaded facility, customers can buy a range of products without having to enter their debit/credit
card details for every online transaction. In this plugin, customer/user can use Wallet Cash during the checkout
and amount will be deducted from their Wallet Cash. They can easily add credit to their wallet.

== Installation ==
